            <h2>CHRONOLOGY</h2>
            <p>
Since our first collection, we have been portraying our society in an anticipation scenario.

</p>
            <p>The first collection "CONSUMABLE" discussed the subject of a frenetic consumerist society going to its own destruction.

It deals with mass distribution and overconsumption, by diverting the symbols of the consumerist society.</p>
            <p>Following its collapse, comes the second collection "PREPPERS".

Encouraging people to prepare for the worst, for a difficult, different future.

The preppers are "the homebody of the apocalypse", they advocate self-sufficiency, to cope with a sclerotic system that could do nothing for them in the event of a crisis.

It does not deal directly with the end of the world but with how to prepare for it if it does happen.

It materializes the atmosphere known as the certainty of chaos: anticipating the end so as not to survive ... but rather to live differently.

"PREPPERS" revisits technical objects such as the compass, the whistle or the carabiner with 3 bright orange waterproof sets : the essentials of a new era.</p>
            <p>The third collection, "PRINCIPIUM", talks about those who have survived and their search for new comfort, a new aesthetic.

                We gradually rediscover the notion of superfluity, and social markers. Human nature reaffirms itself with vanity in an eternal restart.</p>

            <h4>New collection :</h4>
            <p>Then, imagine the economic rebirth of this world. A new world on surfaces but based on the remains of the old fallen world.

A world without industry or production, where people find, harvest and collect obsolete objects from the lost society to invent their own system based on the social and solidarity economy.</p>
            <p>The new collection "LES BIFFINS” is inspired by and pays tribute to these men and women, these ragpickers who have always worked in Paris, Porte Montmartre, for more than a century.

 </p>
            <p>The "biffe" refers to an old piece of cloth. By extension, the "biffins" were ragpickers […]

Everyweek-end, under the ringroad of Paris (France), close to the fleamarket of Saint-Ouen, […] many biffins occupy the 100 places of the "Biffins’ Square" to sell objects of recovery.</p>
            <p>The "Biffins’ Square" is a social market for recovery. These sellers are all actors of "re-use". By their activity on the market, they participate in a recycling economy, sustainable development.

            <p>Extract from the text by Mathieu Ménard about his photographic project « Biffin »

https://www.mathieumenard.fr/biffin</p>
            <p>The biffins are real economic players. Their activity of collecting and reselling various objects, destined for rubbish, bypasses the traditional system of production. This alternative economy would undoubtedly be one of the best suited to allow a society to rebuild itself, in a devastated world, in which money has no more value.</p>
            <p>On the biffins market, there is an amazing diversity of totally disparate objects.

This apparently disorganized accumulation forms finally a coherent whole, like society, where the sum of each individuality forms a whole, rich and inseparable.

The collection “Les Biffins” transcribes the diversity and consistency of this mixture, both in its concept and its aesthetics.</p>
            <p>The pieces are numerous and mismatched, of very various sizes, materials and colors. They are made of steel, brass gold, palladium and pink gold plated, beads, as well as solid silver.

Each of them refers to random objects, more or less useful, more or less precious, found or seen one day on a market on a “biffin” orange cloth. Razors, combs, old-fashioned beads necklaces, seashells, children's toys and matchboxes have inspired this collection that is both conscious and poetic.</p>
            <p>(We collaborated on this project with Mathieu Ménard, photographer.

He produced a striking photographic report, highlighting the reality of these men and women, trough 13 portraits of biffins from the Porte de Clignancourt in Paris.)</p>
            <p>Limited stocks and production to order take part in a global action for a new reasoned consumption process.
